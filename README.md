# Node.js and Express CRUD API

This repository contains a backend project demonstrating how to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Node.js and Express. The API allows performing basic operations on a simulated user database.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment on the server-side.
- Express: A minimalist and flexible web framework for Node.js.
- UUID: A package for generating unique identifiers.

## Features

- **User Creation**: Adds new users to the database.
- **User Reading**: Retrieves the list of all users or a specific user by ID.
- **User Updating**: Modifies information of an existing user.
- **User Deletion**: Removes a user from the database.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js, choosing the LTS version on the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
3. Run `npm init` to initialize the project and create the `package.json` file.
4. Install Express and UUID with `npm install express uuid`.
5. Include `"type": "module"` in `package.json` to use ES6 syntax.

## Usage

To start the server, run `node index.js`. The server will be listening on port 5000.

## Testing the API

You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL. The available routes are:

- GET `/users`: Lists all users.
- GET `/users/:id`: Gets a user by ID.
- POST `/users`: Creates a new user.
- PATCH `/users/:id`: Updates an existing user.
- DELETE `/users/:id`: Deletes a user.
